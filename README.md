# React Skeleton Application
This repo contains two React skeleton apps. The first uses a `webpack` solution, while the second uses `browserify`:

- [Webpack](https://github.com/LearningReact/skeleton-project/tree/webpack)
- [Gulp / Browserify](https://github.com/LearningReact/skeleton-project/tree/browserify)

Neither implementations are to be used in a production system. Instead, they are geared for learning React.
