# Skeleton React App w/ Webpack
This is a simple React skeleton app that uses webpack. I just wanted something to get me started, so nothing fancy.

## Instructions
1. Clone repo
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Run `npm start` to start the wepback-dev-server
4. Navigate to `http://localhost:8080/` in your browser
