# React Skeleton Application
A skeleton project for React apps using Gulp, Browserify, and Watchify. Nothing
too complex. Mainly just to allow the transpiling from .jsx to .js.

## Setup
1. Install modules: `npm install`
2. Start build (and watch for changes): `gulp`
3. Open `index.html` in your browser
4. Profit!
